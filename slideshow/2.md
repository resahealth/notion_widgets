### **Nicole S. chose which job offer to accept.**

“When faced with two exciting job offers, I was unsure about how to make my decision and what factors to consider. I sought advice from over 20 peers and mentors, only to find myself even more stuck and overwhelmed by the 100+ factors they suggested, some of which were contradictory. That's when Inner Compass Work came to my rescue.

Inner Compass Work helped me let go of the idea of finding the "perfect, objective heuristic function" to weigh all the factors I had gathered. Instead, it taught me to focus on subtracting factors to pinpoint the ones that truly mattered to me. The most valuable exercise was imagining an ideal workday in the future and visualizing every small aspect, as it helped me realize which factors were genuinely important.

Because of Inner Compass Work, I was able to make a decision quickly and with conviction. It allowed me to start my new job with confidence, knowing exactly what I wanted to get out of it.”
