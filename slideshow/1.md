### **Cameron S. regrouped after his startup failed.**

“After my last startup in the hard sciences failed, I felt lost, embarrassed, and questioned my own competence. On top of that, I was resentful of the personal sacrifices I had made, including time spent with family, friends, and hobbies.

Through Inner Compass Work, I was able to overcome my mental hurdles and gain clarity on what I truly wanted in my next chapter. I realized the importance of living near friends, having financial freedom for trips, working in a consumer-facing industry, and proving my competence to myself. This led me to take a high-risk, high-reward job in a completely different field – consumer social – and move cities to be closer to my friends.

The conviction I found in myself through Inner Compass Work was so strong that I remained unfazed even when others questioned my decisions. I can genuinely say that Inner Compass Work has helped me find my path and build a fulfilling life, and I will use it again for future life decisions.”
