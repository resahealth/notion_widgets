### **Jason L. decided to turn down a promotion to pursue a new path.**

“I had two incredible opportunities in front of me: a huge promotion at my company and the chance to be a long-term co-founder of a rapidly growing business. My family and friends were impressed and encouraged me to seize the "success" I had earned. However, deep down, I felt hesitant and unsatisfied, without understanding why.

That's when I turned to Inner Compass Work, which helped me discover that both opportunities felt like following the paths of other successful people, rather than nurturing what truly mattered to me. To avoid choosing a "successful" path that might leave me unfulfilled, I decided to turn down both opportunities, despite the disappointment of those around me.

Inner Compass Work helped me identify what genuinely mattered to me. As a result, I crafted a less flashy but far more fulfilling career path in a services business, instead of a venture-backed technology company. I enjoy my day-to-day, I’m passionate about the impact I create for my customers, and I have lots of control and flexibility over my time.”
