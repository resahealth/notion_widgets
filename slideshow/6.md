###  **David Z. chose to denounce his strong religious upbringing.**

“Three years into my PhD in biology, I felt unfulfilled, as I didn't particularly enjoy biology, research, or the school I was attending. I chose this path due to limited options after undergrad and my strong Christian upbringing, which taught me to ignore discontent and trust in "God's plan for me." However, after continuously feeling unfulfilled, I took a bold leap of faith and applied for internships in a different field: business development and sales.

To my surprise, I got the internship, and contrary to my expectation of being punished by God, I really enjoyed it. This experience made me question not only my current path as a biology PhD student, but also my religious upbringing and the role of my own agency in shaping my life.

Inner Compass Work helped me nurture my agency, build conviction in my decision-making abilities, and trust in myself without relying on "God's plan." Denouncing the religion I was raised with was difficult since it shaped my worldview, but Inner Compass Work made the process easier and allowed me to move beyond dualistic thinking (e.g., whether God approves or disapproves). With the support of Inner Compass Work, I am learning to understand my own values, which have been muted due to my religious upbringing which encouraged me to let my decisions be made for me by circumstance.”
