### **Brian B. chose to leave the company he founded and pivot his career.**

“For three years, I passionately built my VC-backed startup, but I began to have a gut feeling that I no longer loved what I was doing. Despite the inertia of my current path and the responsibility I felt towards my co-founder, investors, employees, and customers, I decided to explore this feeling with Inner Compass Work instead of repressing it.

Through Inner Compass Work, I realized that I was on the verge of burnout, but I was unsure about my ideal next steps and how to responsibly exit my company. In just two weeks of Inner Compass Work, I gained the conviction to quit my startup and plan a new career as the head of a product studio. With this newfound clarity, I was able to navigate the highly emotional and complex process of negotiating a smooth, amicable departure from my company.

While I have much to learn in this new chapter, thanks to Inner Compass Work, I now face my new lifestyle full of unknowns with excitement rather than fear.”
