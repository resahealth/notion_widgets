### **Melanie W. gained the conviction to finally start her company.**

“For years, I talked about my desire to be an entrepreneur but kept procrastinating on actually starting a company. I took business classes, listened to podcasts, went to graduate school, and became a management consultant, justifying these steps as preparation for building my company the right way. However, as my friends began launching their startups, I realized that the best way to learn was to take action and dive into company building.

Despite this realization, I still felt resistant to taking the leap, but was unsure why. Inner Compass Work helped me identify my fear of starting a path that I couldn't fully map out ahead of time, as I was scared of entering the unknown. This mindset was incompatible with my entrepreneurial aspirations, and realizing this was an a-ha moment.

Inner Compass Work shifted my mindset away from needing everything mapped out before starting. Instead, it taught me how to navigate novel situations and unforeseen adversity, including subjective and consequential business decisions, by relying on my personal values, insights, and intuition. Thanks to Inner Compass Work, I am finally taking the leap to start my own company and embrace the unknowns with confidence.”
